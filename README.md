IK Spider-Bot. 

Based on the work by [CBerry22](https://github.com/CBerry22/Godot-4.0-Procedural-Animation/). Built to study procedural IK animation and on-the-fly generation of parts.

Features:

* Wall crawling (buggy)
    * The spider does its best to detect walls and cuvy surfaces, but still goes through them
* Procedurally Adjustable number of legs
    * Leg number change currently only works well on the ground
